## Aaron San Jose's UI/UX Portfolio
<p>Collaborated with a UI/UX designer to develop his personal portfolio website!</p>
<p>Aaron created his design specifications on Figma and I was tasked to recreate his vision. I wanted to use this opportunity to gain experience in collaborating with a UI/UX Designer by making his vision come to life and to be as precise to his specifications as possible.</p>
<p>Like me, Aaron transitioned into tech a year after I did and is looking for his first opporunity. With this website we hope he will be able to land interviews easier and show off his projects to finally land that job. </p>

<h2> Tech Stack:
